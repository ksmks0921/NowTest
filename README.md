## Start your app

Start the react native packager, run `yarn run start` or `npm run start` from the root of your project.

### iOS
Build and run the iOS app, run `react-native run-ios` from the root of your project. The first build will take some time. This will automatically start up a simulator also for you on a successful build if one wasn't already started.

### Android
If you haven't already got an android device attached/emulator running then you'll need to get one running (make sure the emulator is with Google Play / APIs). When ready run `react-native run-android` from the root of your project.
